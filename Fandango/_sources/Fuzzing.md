# Fuzzing with Fandango

## Creating a Name Database

Let us now come up with an input that is slightly more complex.
We want to create a set of inputs with _names of persons_ and their respective _age_.
These two values would be _comma-separated_, such that typical inputs would look like this:

```
Alice Doe,27
John Smith,45
...
```

This makes the overall format of our input look like this:

```
<start> ::= <person_name> "," <age>;
```

with `<age>` again being a sequence of digits, and a `<person>`'s name being defined as

```
<person_name> ::= <first_name> " " <last_name>;
```

where both first and last name would be a sequence of letters - first, an uppercase letter, and then a sequence of lowercase letters.
The full definition looks like this:

:::{margin}
In Fandango specs, symbol names are formed as identifiers in Python - that is, they consist of letters, underscores, and digits.
:::

:::{margin}
In Fandango specs, every grammar rule must end with a semicolon.
:::

% TODO
:::{margin}
Future Fandango versions will have shortcuts for specifying character ranges.
:::

```{code-cell}
:tags: ["remove-input"]
!cat persons.fan
```

The symbols `<ascii_uppercase_letter>`, `<ascii_lowercase_letter>`, and `<digits>` are predefined in the [](sec:stdlib); they are defined exactly as would be expected.

Create or download a file [`persons.fan`](persons.fan) and run Fandango on it:

```shell
$ fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10
```

Your output will look like this:

```{code-cell}
:tags: ["remove-input"]
!fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10
```

Such random names are a typical result of _fuzzing_ â€“ that is, testing with randomly generated values.
How do we get these into a program under test?


## Feeding Inputs Into Programs

So far, we have had Fandango simply _output_ the strings it generates.
This is nice for understanding and debugging, but not necessarily useful for processing these inputs further.
Fandango provides a number of means to help you process its output.

## Feed Inputs into a Single file

Fandango has a `-o` option that directs its output into a single file.
To store the generated strings in a file named `persons.txt`, use `-o persons.txt`:

```shell
$ fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -o persons.txt
```

By default, the generated strings are separated by newlines.
With the `-s` option, you can define an alternate separator.
To have the outputs generated separated by `:`, for instance, use

```shell
$ fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -o persons.txt -s ':'
```

## Feed Inputs into Individual Files

With the `-d` option, Fandango can store its strings into individual files in the directory given after `-d`.
They can then be picked up for post-processing.
To store all outputs in a directory named `persons`, for instance, use `-d persons`:

```shell
$ fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -d persons
```

Fandango will create the directory and store the inputs as `Fandango-0001.txt`, `Fandango-0002.txt`, etc.

```{note}
If the directory is already present, Fandango will use that directory.
```

```{warning}
Fandango will overwrite files `Fandango-0001.txt`, `Fandango-0002.txt`, etc., but leave other files in the directory unchanged.
```

If you want a different file extension (for instance, because `.txt` is not suitable), Fandango provides a `--filename-extension` option to set a different one.


## Invoking Programs Directly

You can have Fandango invoke _programs directly_, and have Fandango feed them the generated inputs.
The programs are specified as arguments on the command line.

There are two ways to pass the input into programs, on the command line and via standard input.


### Passing Inputs on the Command Line

When Fandango invokes programs, you can pass input as a file name as last argument on the program's command line.
This is the default, and can also be obtained with the `--input-method=filename` option.

For instance, to test the `wc` program with its own `-c` option and the inputs Fandango generates, use

```shell
$ fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 wc -c
```

The `wc` program is then invoked as `wc -c FILE_1`, `wc -c FILE_2`, etc., where each `FILE` contains an individual input from Fandango.


### Passing Inputs via Standard Input

As an alternative, Fandango can pass inputs via standard input.
For this, use the `--input-method=stdin` option.

For instance, to test the `cat` program with its own `-n` option and the inputs Fandango generates, use

```shell
$ fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 --input-method=stdin cat -n
```

The `cat` program is then invoked repeatedly, each time passing a new Fandango-generated input as its standard input.
