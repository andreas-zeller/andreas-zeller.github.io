# About Me

I do software research.  My students and I create tools and techniques that **help developers build better software**&mdash;by automatically testing, analyzing, and debugging its code and its development process.

Our approaches have proven quite influential in academia and industry.  My [Curriculum Vitae](assets/ZellerCV.pdf) lists the most important achievements.

## Current Projects

Our **research projects** involve generating software tests, automated debugging and repair, analyzing mobile systems, analyzing user interfaces, and more. Essentially, our research focuses on the following questions:

* How can we systematically test complex software systems?
* How can we accurately determine and characterize input formats?
* How can we explain causes and circumstances of software failures?

Our **solutions** typically apply and combine several techniques including dynamic analysis, static analysis, specification mining, test generation, natural language processing, machine learning, constraint solving, and formal languages:

* In 2023, I have received an **ERC Advanced Grant** of 2.5 million EUR for the project ["Semantics of Software Systems" (S3)](https://www.cispa.de/s3) on massive generation of tests and oracles for software. Come work with me!
* Since 2022, most of our projects focus on semantic fuzzing and debugging, centered around our all-new [ISLa specification language and input generator](https://rindphi.github.io/isla/).
* Since 2021, my [Debugging Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/) presents and implements techniques for automated debugging and repair, and [The Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/) introduces test generation ("fuzzing") techniques. Both books are interactive – you can execute and edit the code right in your browser.

I am hiring [PhDs and PostDocs who would like to work on these topics](https://jobs.cispa.saarland/de_DE/jobs/detail/postdoctoral-researchers-for-s3-semantics-of-software-systems-227). Apply now!


## Current Papers

My papers can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-Qytr_YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), in the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/profile/81100307506), and in [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/z/Zeller:Andreas.html). For recent works and preprints, check out my [CISPA publication list](https://publications.cispa.de/search?q=%3Aauthor%3A%20Zeller).


## My Courses

* In Winter 2024/25, we offer our advanced course on automated debugging, based on [The Debugging Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/).
* In Winter 2025/26, we will offer our advanced course on security testing, based on [The Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/).

Every semester, we also offer [seminars and proseminars around automated testing and debugging](https://cms.cispa.saarland/).

Check out all our courses [here](https://cms.cispa.saarland/).

## Theses

If you are a student of Saarland University and have fun with automated program analysis, testing, and debugging, you might want to do a thesis with us.  [Here are the details on how to do a thesis with us.](Theses.html)


## My Blog

My [blog](Blog.html) has a mixture of various topics from academia and software development, often with a humorous touch.  Here is a selection of popular posts:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  {% if post.tags contains "popular" %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      (<span class="date">{{ post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}</span>)

  {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## Watch Me

I am a frequent speaker at events. Here are two recorded talks I am particularly proud of.

### 2020: Learning the Language of Failure

In my 2020 CASA Distinguished Lecture ["Learning the Language of Failure"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZW1DI2PxvI), I show some highlights of our current work:

* how to automatically learn circumstances of a given failure, expressed over features of input elements;
* how to automatically infer input languages as readable grammars, and how to use them for massive fuzzing; and
* how to systematically and precisely characterize the set of inputs that causes a given failure – the "language of failure".

Enjoy the show! [Annotated slides](assets/CASA-2020-Learning-the-Language-of-Failure.pdf) are available, too.

### 2018: Outstanding Research Award Keynote

These days, I also spend quite some time giving career advice. In my [ICSE 2018 SIGSOFT Award keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5jLjcxnwfU), I
unfold three lessons on _impact in software engineering research_:

1. Do relevant work
2. Strive for simplicity
3. Keep on innovating

Again, detailed [slides and full manuscript](assets/ICSE-2018-Keynote-Zeller.pdf) are available.
