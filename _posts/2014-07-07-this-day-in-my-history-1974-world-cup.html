Today exactly 40 years ago, on July 7, 1974, my family and I watched the Football World Cup Final between Netherlands and West Germany on a tiny TV in Beirut, Lebanon. &nbsp;1974 was the last year before the civil war broke out, and Beirut was still a wonderful post-colonial middle-east city with clear Western (and mostly French) influence; it also was a major tourist destination for Westeners. &nbsp;I remember Beirut as chic, white and golden, the Beeqaa Valley as green and incredibly fertile, and the Roman temples of Baalbek as white and green – it was about the first time my then nine-year old self fully realized the beauty of landscapes and architecture. &nbsp;All the charms and beauty of Beirut would get lost in the 16 years of civil war that would ignite only a few months later, and well-armed soldiers on every major crossing were a sign of things to come.<br /><br />How would we get to Beirut, you may ask? &nbsp;At the time, my father was a German teacher in Bangui, Central African Republic, and we lived there in a nice house with a lavish garden; every Summer, we would return to Europe, though, and on some of these return trips, we would include stopovers in locations on the way. &nbsp;At the time, the Western and Eastern blocks were still fighting for dominance in Africa, and consequently, the Central African Republic was well-connected – both by Western Airlines (UTA and Air Afrique), as well by Soviet Airlines (Aeroflot). &nbsp;With Aeroflot being cheaper than the others, we would use the saved money for stopovers, which is how we ended up for short trips to Moscow, Russia; Cairo, Egypt; and, in 1974, Beirut, Lebanon.<br /><br />The flight crew and us were in the same hotel, and my father and the crew had already made acquaintances during the trip from Africa. &nbsp;It turned out that this very day was the finals of the 1974 Soccer World Cup in Munich, with the Netherlands playing against West Germany. &nbsp;The crew also knew that we were Germans – and one of their rooms had a TV! &nbsp;So at breakfast in the restaurant, they approached us and told us that they wanted to watch the finals later today. &nbsp;Would we like to join them? &nbsp;Of course, my parents gladly accepted.<br /><br />So my sister and I found ourselves in a stuffy Beirut hotel room with our parents and a Russian flight crew, in front of a tiny, blurry, black and white TV screen with the audio in a language I did not understand (Arabic? Russian?). &nbsp;It was even hard to distinguish the teams, although the light grey team seemed to be the Germans, and the darker grey team seemed to be the Dutch. &nbsp;And I occasionally got the words "Beckenbauer" and "Cruyff", whom I identified as the main protagonists of their respective teams. &nbsp;On every goal shot, vodka bottles were passed, and the crew's eyes got more and more watery. &nbsp;The game lasted for 90 minutes, and at the end, the Germans won.<br /><br />At this time, I was a nine-year old boy, and you might think I would have been super enthusiastic about watching the World Cup Final, captured by the game, and knowing each single player in the team. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. &nbsp;Having spent the past year in Africa, I knew nothing about German football, its teams, or its players; nor did I know how the world cup went so far. &nbsp;All the news we had were a weekly news magazine, Der Spiegel, which normally would arrive one to three weeks late; occasional short-wave radio news; and French Newsreels, to be shown in the local cinemas.<br /><br />Still, I was glued to the screen, like my parents, like the crew with their wide open, bright blue eyes. &nbsp;But in this moment, what I found thrilling was not so much that Germany was just about to win the World Cup. &nbsp;It also wasn't that I was in a hotel room in Beirut with a bunch of Russians on my way back from Africa. &nbsp;It was that I was looking at real live TV.
